/**
 * The Controller is a central component to the E-Mail Notification System managing most tasks as well as providing an
 * API to outside systems. It is the only class to communicate with the classes from the 'model' and 'view' packages.
 * The CheckerUtil class can call the Controller to instruct it to send a report about a certain sensor to a subscriber
 * of that sensor, or to instruct it to send an alert about the malfunction of a certain sensor to one or multiple
 * subscribers.
 * The project website may call the Controller to issue a confirmation mail containing a confirmation code to be sent to
 * a given e-mail address.
 * Furthermore, the Controller allows the website to add, delete or get information about subscriptions.
 * The Controller class contains an instance of a MailBuilder, a MailSender, a SubscriptionDAO and a SensorDAO.
